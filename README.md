# Employee-Dashboard-Angular
My very first frontend project ever.
Please do not be too critical, it's a project that focuses more on learning new features rather than good design.
## Features
* Uses signals for reactivity and rxjs only for asynchronous processing.
* Supports CRUD operations and uses reactive forms.
* Manually made UI components that may not look amazing, but were a very helpful css learning experience.
* Uses HTTPS and CORS so you will need an SSL certificate to check it out.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository** locally:  
* `git clone https://github.com/JPitogo-ph/Employee-Dashboard-Angular`  
* `cd Employee-Dashboard-Angular`  
2. **Install dependencies**  
* `npm install`  
3. **Configuration**  
* You will need to configure angular.json to provide a self-signed SSL certificate as this project was only configured to use https.  
4. **Run the backend**  
* This project relies on an ASP.NET backend located in a separate repo, please make sure this is running first.  
5. **Run the project**  
* Enter `ng serve` in the Angular CLI to run the project.
